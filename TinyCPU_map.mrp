    Number used as logic:                       26 out of  41,000    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              26
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    0
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  13,400    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           27
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            17 out of      27   62%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   1 out of      27    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           9 out of      27   33%
    Number of unique control sets:               1
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of  82,000    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
